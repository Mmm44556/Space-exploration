#主題:太空探險(動機:背景是隨便逛GITHUB看到才想做的)
這是我第一個用React開發的個人作品，在這之間做了許多修正像是最讓我頭痛的應該就是UI設計，很期待能看到最終成果。
剛開始組件設計時其實也是一頭亂，如果跑去看一下內部代碼會說:「這是甚麼鬼吧!」哈哈，那麼至於設計方式也是用基本的組件設計，坑很多但也讓我開始熟悉這些HOOKS的用法了。

剛開始會有提示用於告訴用戶點擊按鈕開始，接著會進入動畫模式，結束後總共有數顆星球可以做選擇而選擇到的星球會展示相關資訊等等，作品功能大概只有這樣。

"This is my first personal project developed using React. During the process, I made many adjustments, with UI design being the most challenging aspect that gave me a headache. I am really looking forward to seeing the final outcome.
At the beginning, when designing the components, it was quite chaotic. If you were to look at the internal code, you would probably say, 'What on earth is this?!' Haha. As for the design approach, I used basic component design, which had its fair share of pitfalls, but it also helped me become familiar with the usage of these hooks."
